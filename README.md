In this project , I have useed products info to make analysis , this data contains some product and sub categories in differnet countries from 2020 to 2018 and measure the rate of every procudt and subcatgory
we want to know some question to help decision makers to make decisions , i want to know which country sold out more product and max rate for every country,
want to know which year sales and month declined and increased , and which product and sub category sold out more.
to answer this quesitions , i have used some analytical tools like Excel , Python and Ms PowerBI .
